# Description of the assignment
The assignment was to create a working chat app. There should have password-protected chat-rooms and public chat-rooms, all listed separately. You should be able to create new rooms, and if a room is not used it disappears. 
VG:
You see when someone writes in the chat, you can see who is in each room. And a '/' and a commando can add two different API-outputs.

# Description of the app
You enter your username in the startpage. There's a main Chat. Rooms are listed on the right side. Hovering over a room will show who is currently there. When a new room is created, if a password isn't entered, it becomes a public room. You can see when others are writing. When you are writing a message if you put a / in front of a word, it turns into a Gif. You can have any number of gifs in a message. There are more than two word you can turn into Gifs.
